# BFUDPClient

Just a testing application for retrieving the Keeper data straight from the game server itself.  
_Note: Currently only the RushLarge is mapped. Tested only on BF4 Rush._

## Usage

```
BFUDPClient.exe <serverGuid>
```

## Credits

@Christianuss for making me aware of this endpoint and the documentation of the BF3 endpoint. Helped solving the BF4 which is very similar.
